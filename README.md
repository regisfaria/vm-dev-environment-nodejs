# Development Environment With Vagrant

## Overview

I was needing to create a VM of my current development environment so I could develop in other machines. This repository is the result of that objective.

## Installation & Running

You will need to install: **Vagrant, Virtual Box(or other VM providers)**.

After that, simply run: `vagrant up` to bring up the VM.

As soon as the VM windows is up, you can login with:
**login**: vagrant
**password**: vagrant
And then run the command: `startx` to start the GUI.

*take note of the command "vagrant up" response, because it will download some of it's dependencies. You will only be able to run the command above when **all dependencies downloads are finished, please wait for its execution**.*
